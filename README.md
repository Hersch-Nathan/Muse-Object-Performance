# Muse Object Performance

## Overview

This piece is an interactive performance examining how audiences respond to different forms of object performance. The audience will experience the same short piece four times, each performed through a different medium placed along a spectrum.

First, a single object (such as a blanket) will be animated as an expressive marionette. Next, the piece will be performed with a simple hand puppet, then with an animatronic character, and finally with a small robot. If time allows, additional mediums may also be explored.

The goal of this work is to investigate how meaning and emotional response shift as the object changes, and to provoke curiosity about the boundaries between object, character, and performer.
